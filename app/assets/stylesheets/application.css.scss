 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will
 * include all the files listed below.

 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets,
 * vendor/assets/stylesheets, or vendor/assets/stylesheets of plugins, if any,
 * can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear
 * at the top of the compiled file, but it's generally better to create a new
 * file per style scope.
